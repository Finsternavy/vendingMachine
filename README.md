# Vending Machine

Authors: Christopher Finster & Ingri Lopez.

Project begin date: 29MAY2017.

This project is for CST-135 Computer Programming II, Grand Canyon University.

Overview 
If you use the Vending Machine then you will be able to choose between drinks and snacks. 
The intent of this project is to create a realistic representation of a working vending machine and to have well defined classes that enhance readability and efficiency. The flow and intent of flow should be obvious and easily traceable. The base classes have been written to allow for functionality and are ready for GUI implementation. 
The proposed flow of this project is intended to be deliberate and should be familiar to anyone who has used a vending machine. Each step of the process will be easy to understand and each screen will guide the user through the process. 
The program will have two separate interfaces, one for a customer and one for a servicer(Boss). 
Servicer(Boss) interface will allow necessary adjustments to products and inventory. The goal is ease of use. 
Customers should experience ease of use and a streamlined process with as few steps as possible. 
Customer should also feel as if they have options and the ability to change their minds and their selection easily. 
There should be no “breaking points” or need to navigate through unnecessary screens to make adjustments to selection. 

Proposed customer flow:
Insert money > select category > select item > dispense / cancel / add funds / add more items > repeat as necessary. 

Proposed servicer(Boss) flow:
Admin login > passcode entry > select area of interest (inventory / financials / passcode change) > item selection / account control / enter new pin > item adjustments > adjustment confirmation > return to main.
